Easy OCW assists with the building of the Apache Open Climate Workbench and 
its dependencies.

Flags:
    -h  Display this help message.
    -e  Install and configure a virtualenv environment before installation.
    -q  Quiet install. User prompts are removed (when possible).

It is recommended that you pass -e when running this script. If you don't, 
parts of this installation will pollute your global Python install. 
If you're unsure, pass -e just to be safe!

N.B. This install script has been tested against Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.
Please report problems with this script to dev@climate.apache.org
